  <p>Turku Agile Day is back! We’re bringing you again the coziest software conference in Finland! The event will take place on May 12th-13th (Monday-Tuesday) in ICT-Talo in Turku and it will be one day of workshops (Monday) and one day of talks (Tuesday) and, of course, time to network on both days.</p>
