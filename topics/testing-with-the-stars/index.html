  <h2>What it is</h2>
  
  <p>"Testing with the Stars" (loosely modeled on the popular TV show "Dancing with the Stars") is a testing competition quite like Programming with the Stars held in <a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/programmingwiththestars/">Agile2009</a>. The purpose of the competition is to promote testing skills, techniques and how a tester can help agile team to build software that matters. For someone. And

  Finals on Wednesday May 16th 2012</p>
  
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>Each pair will have a 10 minute window to demonstrate something they find valuable in a pre-defined category. The pairs will have time to do a fair amount of prep work to pull something off in the given time. Pairs will work on their choice of tools, technology stacks, languages, and code bases.</p>

  <p>After the 10 minute demonstration, the judges will provide feedback and score on the show. The audience then gets to give their scores to the contestants to a Big Visible Leaderboard. Three best will continue the journey on Wednesday in semi-finals and finals and to the Big Stages.</p>
