    <p>You've been there. You are tasked with implementing a product that someone else cooked up. What do do next? Follow the spec you say?</p>
    <p>Wrong!</p>
    <p>Developing a product without this Vision is not just waste, it is bad business for you and for your customer. Before we start implementing any product we must explore it's reason to exist, what customers it benefits and ultimately how it can help your customers (not you!) make money.</p>
    <p>In this workshop we will take an example and go through a simple process that helps us explore a product idea to the point that a spec is just a reference, but the product comes alive in the minds of the team members.</p>

    <p>Organisational change fails more often than it succeeds – so say some – but why? When promoting change in an organisation, have you considered the conditions that allow change to take place in the first place and to be sustainable afterwards? This interactive workshop start from the Six Conditions for Change from the work of Clare Graves and expands with some related models, all with the target of mentoring the participants on using the learning in practice.</p>

    <h3>Liftoffs for Agile Teams and Projects</h3>

    <p>Liftoff – it's the unexplored, often ignored, Agile project practice. Liftoff gives impetus to your projects in a way that starts the project team, and the business, on the trajectory to success. As the first act of the flight, a rocket launch requires an entire set of systems to successfully lift the vehicle into orbit – not just the vehicle itself, but all the systems needed for smoothly moving off the ground into space. Likewise, your project needs its entire set of supporting systems in place to begin a successful journey to delivery.</p>
    <p> In this workshop based on her new book, Diana Larsen will lead you on an interactive mission to explore effective Liftoff meetings, including the newly introduced Agile Chartering model.</p>

    <h3>Patterns for Improved Customer Interaction</h3>

  <div class="description column two-thirds">
    <p>With the emphasis on in-depth customer interaction during development, agile team members are being asked to take an active role in working with customers. This evolving role poses a big challenge for many who, in the past, rarely met “real” customers. Linda Rising presents patterns she has used successfully to help software professionals in their direct, face-to-face interactions with customers. These patterns describe solutions to common problems that occur again and again when dealing with customers and users.</p>
    <p>The patterns Linda discusses have memorable names such as It’s A Relationship—Not A Sale, Be Responsive, Show Personal Integrity, Build Trust, and Take Your Licks. Pattern names build a vocabulary that allows you and your development team to have meaningful conversations about—and to ultimately improve—customer relationships and the software you deliver.</p>
    <p>Benefits from this tutorial:
      <ul>
        <li>A vocabulary based on patterns to improve communication with customers</li>
        <li>Simple and powerful ways to improve your own personal interactions</li>
        <li>How to focus on what is best for both you and your customers</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Taylorism and Mass Production - Why The Software Factory Fails</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>by <strong><a href="/speakers/#marcus-ahnve">Marcus Ahnve</a></strong></li>
      <li>11:15 - 12:00</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="description column two-thirds">
    <ul>
      <li>Why do we separate development from maintenance and operations?</li>
      <li>Why do system architects chose frameworks and write UML diagrams but do not write any code?</li>
      <li>Why do we measure how many lines of code a developer writes?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The theories of Frederick Taylor and those that followed them still today sets the norm for how organizations are managed. What we see as normal and common ways to organize work have their historical roots in early 1900's steel mills. These practices make agile adoption difficult, hinders empirical processes and self organizing teams.</p>

    <p>The talk provides an explanation to why IT-organizations are managed like factories, why these fail, and how to start the change into a succesful agile organization.</p>

    <h3>The empirical process - at the very core of agile. </h3>

  <div class="description column two-thirds">
    <p>Agile is all about empirical processes, controlled by feedback loops. But what does it mean?</p>
    <p>Most agile practices and principles are rooted in control theory. Truth be told, most ways of doing things well are. Knowing these root concepts will improve the outcome of any undertaking, software development or other. In this “popular science”-session, software development will be described as a (simplified) mathematical process. The session will teach how feedback, sensors, noise and delays affect outcome, error, robustness and other properties of a development process.</p>

    <p>To create an awesome product two things are important from the start: common understanding of the vision, and validation of the idea behind it. The best we know to reach these goals is to create a prototype. We would like to tell you how we do it.</p>
