    <p>Two important areas of agile management are empowering teams and growing structure. Teams are complex systems working in complex environments. To adapt fully in their environments teams must be able to self-organize. Yet managers need to guide teams so that they produce value in the organization and act according to the organizations goals. Combining self-organization with managerial guidance is the main theme of Delegation Poker.</p>
	<p>Many teams operate within the context of a complex organization, and that it is important to consider the form of the social network through which communication flows. In Meddlers, the players discuss and explore different options of structure for larger scale development organizations.</p>

    <p>It is often said the ScrumMaster is a team coach, committed on the continuous 
improvement of the team. But… what the *** does this mean? What resources does such 
a ScrumMaster need to perform in the role and how can these be learned?
In this interactive presentation I will show some useful techniques that ScrumMasters can 
apply in their daily work to support your self-organising team. The audience will also be 
invited to share their experiences and a few case studies will be shown.
The presentation is also useful for product owners who want new ways of working with 
their team - they're servant leaders as well, after all - and, in general, is recommended for 
everybody who is interested in learning new ways to interact with people.</p>

    <p>Software development is not a production process but a collective creative process. Analogies would be improvisation theatre, team sports or the behaviour of socially living animals. The “collective” aspect of software development is not only about arranging duties and solving integration problems. The key part is distributing and sharing information and making individual knowledge available to all team members.</p>

	<p>Traditional approaches are asynchronous, rendering the team a set of individuals rather than a whole complete in itself as it is demanded by the agile philosophy. The step beyond is real-time collaboration: common synchronous crafting on the same artefacts by several individuals. Changes are distributed instantly; the artefact itself becomes an additional communication channel.</p>

	<p>This workshop is designed to give people a real feel for the different style of work without need for knowledge of specific software technologies or development approaches. We will give teams a task to accomplish together using Google Docs. You only need to bring a laptop that can run Google Docs.</p>

    <p>Creating awesome web apps for human end users is challenging. Understanding requirements early and turning them into a working solution is crucial to get the right thing done and minimize wasted effort. Additionally, in case of complicated apps with a longer development lifecycle, the codebase can gradually lose its flexibility and be in danger of regressing into unmaintainable legacy spaghetti.</p>
    <p>There exist various different approaches for both of these problems, but Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) provides a method for tackling both while providing some additional benefits. In this session we are first going to discuss the why and what, and then try the tools and techniques of ATDD in an example case to learn how to enable building great web apps.</p>
    <p>Note that terminology around the theme abounds. Similar or related topics include at least Test Driven Requirements, Functional Test Driven Development, Behavior Driven Developmen, Story Test Driven Development, Executable Requirements, End-to-End Test Driven Development, Customer Test Driven Development, Business-Facing Test Driven Development, and Specification by Example.</p>

    <p>Liftoff – it's the unexplored, often ignored, Agile project practice. Liftoff gives impetus to your projects in a way that starts the project team, and the business, on the trajectory to success. As the first act of the flight, a rocket launch requires an entire set of systems to successfully lift the vehicle into orbit – not just the vehicle itself, but all the systems needed for smoothly moving off the ground into space. Likewise, your project needs its entire set of supporting systems in place to begin a successful journey to delivery.</p>
    <p> In this workshop based on her new book, Diana Larsen will lead you on an interactive mission to explore effective Liftoff meetings, including the newly introduced Agile Chartering model.</p>

    <p>With the emphasis on in-depth customer interaction during development, agile team members are being asked to take an active role in working with customers. This evolving role poses a big challenge for many who, in the past, rarely met “real” customers. Linda Rising presents patterns she has used successfully to help software professionals in their direct, face-to-face interactions with customers. These patterns describe solutions to common problems that occur again and again when dealing with customers and users.</p>
    <p>The patterns Linda discusses have memorable names such as It’s A Relationship—Not A Sale, Be Responsive, Show Personal Integrity, Build Trust, and Take Your Licks. Pattern names build a vocabulary that allows you and your development team to have meaningful conversations about—and to ultimately improve—customer relationships and the software you deliver.</p>
    <p>Benefits from this tutorial:
      <ul>
        <li>A vocabulary based on patterns to improve communication with customers</li>
        <li>Simple and powerful ways to improve your own personal interactions</li>
        <li>How to focus on what is best for both you and your customers</li>

    <p>Outside-in development doesn't mean starting at the user interface, it means starting at the outside of whatever you want to discover.</p>
     <p>On a brand new application, the first thing you need to discover is your domain model. Those fancy ajax gizmos can wait. This session will be a kata-style tutorial. Working from a single Cucumber scenario, we will drive out a domain model, then like BDD magicians, we'll slip in a user interface around the domain model without touching the tests.</p>
     <p>Attend this workshop to learn how to write Cucumber scenarios that last, by expressing them in the language of the domain. You'll learn how to engineer high-quality Cucumber step definition and support code, and see the benefits as your application evolves. A masterclass in BDD as it's meant to be done.</p>
     <p>This is intended to be a hands-on tutorial, so to take an active part, please ensure you have installed Ruby and the Cucumber, Capybara and Sinatra rubygems. If you just want to come along and watch, that's fine too.</p>

      Git is a versatile tool that can be adapted to multiple
      different workflows. Possibility to have feature branches, code
      reviews and rebase provide a solid toolset to maintain your code
      cleaner and let people collaborate without a big overhead of managing
      version control system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distributed version control systems have also added new and
      different ways to organize the work. No longer people have tied
      to a centralized server or internet connection, there's a new kind
      of freedom to do things.
    </p>
    <p>
      This workshop will go through practices that will help your
      everyday development using git. The idea is not to present One
      True Model(tm) that works everyday, but to offer you a set of
      tools that you can ground your own agile development workflow on.
      Aim is also to cover some more advanced topics of git, like
      rewriting history, hooks and recovering from disasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the workshop a laptop and basic knowledge of git are
      preferred, though not mandatory :)

    <p>In this session, you will be the Product Owner. You need to release a
product version after 7 Sprints. You have your backlog of features
stakeholders have requested? What kind of delivery commitments do you feel
safe to make? What commitments might not be wise? How can you plan that
effectively?</p>

<p>Release planning tries to peer into the future and establish some sense
into future progress. We will look at:
  - some simple (but effective) tools to both plan and communicate key
goals and constraints.
  - different strategic approaches to managing the release and backlog
  - the concept of velocity and its appropriate use in longer term planning

But of course, first you need to make your plan. For real*.

    <p>For IT professionals who want to pick up Kanban, the agile42 Kanban Pizza Game is a unique and fun learning experience that lets you create and improve a Kanban board in a risk-free environment.
	<p>Unlike all other Lean and Kanban games we have seen, the Pizza Game is not based a fixed Kanban board and a pre-defined value stream. Instead the Pizza Game covers the creation of a new Kanban board from an emerging process and allows you to modify the board freely, which closely mirrors what a new Kanban team needs to do early in the transition process.</p>

    <p>Realtime monitoring provides everyone on a team, as well as interested stakeholders, with a shared and deepened understanding of how a system performs. Visualize it and you get direct feedback form the heart of your system. In this session we want to share our experiences with introducing monitoring and how the feedback it provided influenced both system design and team collaboration.</p>
    <p>We will use Graphite, a monitoring tool that makes data gathering no harder than printing “Hello world” and realtime visualization even easier. We will show how a monitoring tool like this; simple, instantly available and used continuously; was instrumental in implementing change in behaviour and collaboration.</p>

    <p>I've wondered for some time whether much of Agile's success was the result of the placebo effect, that is, good things happened because we believed they would. The placebo effect is a startling reminder of the power our minds have over our perceived reality. Now cognitive scientists tell us that this is only a small part of what our minds can do.</p>
    <p>Research has identified what I like to call "an agile mindset," an attitude that equates failure and problems with opportunities for learning, a belief that we can all improve over time, that our abilities are not fixed but evolve with effort. What's surprising about this research is the impact of an agile mindset on creativity and innovation, estimation, and collaboration in and out of the workplace.</p>
    <p>I'll relate what's known about this mindset and share some practical suggestions that can help all of us become even more agile.</p>
