    <p>GitHub is in the unique position of creating a development tool suite and also using that same suite to rapidly build, review, ship and improve our own code base. Our process is named the GitHub Flow and it shares many traits with Agile approaches.  In this hands-on workshop, I'll help you experience this process with live follow-along examples using the GitHub.com platform, Forks, Git branching, Pull Requests, and continuous integration, along with stories and anecdotes from a typical workday at GitHub.  At a few strategic pause points, I'll take questions, reflect on how what you are experiencing differs from your workplace, and do a demonstration of code change and deployment processes on a live GitHub.com Internet-facing application.</p>

	<p>What if a crisp white envelope dropped into you letter box today? What if it contained a neat, gold-blocked invitation to spends some time considering what really matters to you?</p>

<p>Would you be interested? Would you be interested enough to commit the time and effort implicit in accepting the invitation?</p>

<p>In this keynote, Bob Marshall extends an invitation to explore how you feel about work, the extent to which your personal needs – and the needs of others – are presently being met by work, and the part Agile can play in attending better to those needs.</p>

    <h3>Agile-ish Life at GitHub</h3>

    <p>GitHub's unique work environment is based on open source and agile approaches and is what many employees describe as "the best place" they've ever worked.  What makes them say that?</p>
    <p>
    Together, we'll explore some of the workflows and business tactics that makes GitHub unique–dare I say, almost odd–but highly productive and profitable.  We'll examine, by use of real examples, never-before-seen app screenshots, and process demos, why everyone at GitHub is enabled to do ops work from a chatroom and how that affects the culture from customer support staff all the way to network infrastructure specialists.  We'll continue the culture and tool exploration with a look at how task assignments are made by open allocation, how that matches passion with projects, and a review of some of the biggest challenges the company is facing today.</p>
    <p>
    We'll conclude with a comparison of the development, assignment, and communication elements of Agile we've extracted mostly as-is and which ones we've brutally bent to fit our construction of desktop apps, web sites, and virtual appliances. You'll come away shocked, surprised, and inspired to change your organziation and leverage some of the tactics used at GitHub.</p>

    <p>This is a true story. Me getting an assignment to a project which had 0 tests. And no other developers. <br/>
    Old, yet live code written in Java/Groovy/Grails. Intertwined responsibilities, messy code. Typical length of a class was hundreds of lines of code.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the presentation, I’ll show two example cases of introducing new features to the project. The first is a story of adding a search criteria to a list of 15 parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
    The other example is total refactoring of handling files transferred to the system using FTP. It included both changes to the supported file types and the structure of the code.
    </p>
    <p>
    In both examples, I try to think the end results (code) from both maintainability perspective and from business perspective.</p>

		<h3>New agile model for public sector</h3>

		<p>We will cover the essential prerequisites for agile projects and some particular challenges of the public sector.
Different types of contracts are covered. As a novel development, we present how we have successfully
made the source code publicly available through Github on some of our projects with the Finnish National
Board of Education (Opetushallitus) and Ministry of Justice, Finland (Oikeusministeriö). </p>
		<p>Public source code opens up new possibilities for agile projects and in this game everybody can win. We
have also been able to negotiate and develop surprisingly agile contracts and processes with the Finnish 
Board of Education and National Land Survey of Finland (Maanmittauslaitos), which we'll present.</p>
		<p>To reap the benefits of agile with the public sector, we need customers, vendors and developers to work together. 
The old ways must be challenged, but this is an opportunity rather than a threat. Whether you want or not, 
the game is afoot!</p>

    <p>Pick your worse habit. Something that you really would need to change. Now, pick a habit that you like, that feels safe, makes you feel good. Next, think about the effort required to replace both of these habits with new habits. Multiply this effort with, say, twenty. That gives you an idea of how difficult it can feel for a manager to change his way of feeling and thinking going from traditional top-down to self-directed agile. In collaboration with the audience Riina will take us through chain of thought combining recent neuroscientific findings to what makes agile transformations so challenging on an individual level, especially for managers. No slideshows. Presence. Neuro. Emotions. Storytelling. Together. </p>

  <div class="description column two thirds">
    <p>What is the role of architecture in a modern software project? Have we forgotten the value of proper planning in our effort to be flexible and agile while stripping away all excess fat? Or are we really better off without the architects in their ivory towers and fine without the big architecture bibles gathering dust on the developers' tables? This talk will introduce you to lean architecture, a place where architects and agilists can share the same camp fire and still leave with their neckbeards intact. We will see the value and the role of both the architect and the architectural documentation in an agile project.</p>
