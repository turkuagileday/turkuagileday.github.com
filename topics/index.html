    <p>GitHub is in the unique position of creating a development tool suite and also using that same suite to rapidly build, review, ship and improve our own code base. Our process is named the GitHub Flow and it shares many traits with Agile approaches.  In this hands-on workshop, I'll help you experience this process with live follow-along examples using the GitHub.com platform, Forks, Git branching, Pull Requests, and continuous integration, along with stories and anecdotes from a typical workday at GitHub.  At a few strategic pause points, I'll take questions, reflect on how what you are experiencing differs from your workplace, and do a demonstration of code change and deployment processes on a live GitHub.com Internet-facing application.</p>

    <h3>Agile-ish Life at GitHub</h3>

    <p>GitHub's unique work environment is based on open source and agile approaches and is what many employees describe as "the best place" they've ever worked.  What makes them say that?</p>
    <p>
    Together, we'll explore some of the workflows and business tactics that makes GitHub unique–dare I say, almost odd–but highly productive and profitable.  We'll examine, by use of real examples, never-before-seen app screenshots, and process demos, why everyone at GitHub is enabled to do ops work from a chatroom and how that affects the culture from customer support staff all the way to network infrastructure specialists.  We'll continue the culture and tool exploration with a look at how task assignments are made by open allocation, how that matches passion with projects, and a review of some of the biggest challenges the company is facing today.</p>
    <p>
    We'll conclude with a comparison of the development, assignment, and communication elements of Agile we've extracted mostly as-is and which ones we've brutally bent to fit our construction of desktop apps, web sites, and virtual appliances. You'll come away shocked, surprised, and inspired to change your organziation and leverage some of the tactics used at GitHub.</p>
