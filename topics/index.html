    <p>Two important areas of agile management are empowering teams and growing structure. Teams are complex systems working in complex environments. To adapt fully in their environments teams must be able to self-organize. Yet managers need to guide teams so that they produce value in the organization and act according to the organizations goals. Combining self-organization with managerial guidance is the main theme of Delegation Poker.</p>
	<p>Many teams operate within the context of a complex organization, and that it is important to consider the form of the social network through which communication flows. In Meddlers, the players discuss and explore different options of structure for larger scale development organizations.</p>

    <p>It is often said the ScrumMaster is a team coach, committed on the continuous 
improvement of the team. But… what the *** does this mean? What resources does such 
a ScrumMaster need to perform in the role and how can these be learned?
In this interactive presentation I will show some useful techniques that ScrumMasters can 
apply in their daily work to support your self-organising team. The audience will also be 
invited to share their experiences and a few case studies will be shown.
The presentation is also useful for product owners who want new ways of working with 
their team - they're servant leaders as well, after all - and, in general, is recommended for 
everybody who is interested in learning new ways to interact with people.</p>

	<p>Personas	are	widely	used	to	describe	the	vital end	users.	Usually	designers	are

    <p>In this session, you will be the Product Owner. You need to release a
product version after 7 Sprints. You have your backlog of features
stakeholders have requested? What kind of delivery commitments do you feel
safe to make? What commitments might not be wise? How can you plan that
effectively?</p>

<p>Release planning tries to peer into the future and establish some sense
into future progress. We will look at:
  - some simple (but effective) tools to both plan and communicate key
goals and constraints.
  - different strategic approaches to managing the release and backlog
  - the concept of velocity and its appropriate use in longer term planning

But of course, first you need to make your plan. For real*.

* Okay, as real as it can get in a conference session.</p>

    <p>For IT professionals who want to pick up Kanban, the agile42 Kanban Pizza Game is a unique and fun learning experience that lets you create and improve a Kanban board in a risk-free environment.
	<p>Unlike all other Lean and Kanban games we have seen, the Pizza Game is not based a fixed Kanban board and a pre-defined value stream. Instead the Pizza Game covers the creation of a new Kanban board from an emerging process and allows you to modify the board freely, which closely mirrors what a new Kanban team needs to do early in the transition process.</p>
	<p>Do you like pizza? Are you interested in Kanban? If so, there's no excuse for skipping this game! (Max. 24 participants.)</p>

    <p>We completed our 11 month journey of creating a realtime space shooter
for Android using Scala programming language. We did the project in
our freetime and you can check out the end result at
www.punchwolf.com/scawar .

This presentation takes a dive in to those 11 months of intense
development and takes a look at things we think went well and things
we would definitely do differently if we were to start again from the
beginning. We will look at how functional programming fits writing
games from the perspective of Scala language and how well they suit
the Android platform. We will discover what challenges does a
freetime, multi-location project present to agile methods. We will
also present some hard-earned lessons on planning, motivation and game
optimizing.</p>

    <h3>It's Impossible To Buy Technical Excellence</h3>

    <p>Technical excellence, meaning e.g. quality code, sound architecture, good test automation and coverage, continuous integration and continuous deployment is the pre-requisite of sustainable software development.   Sustainability of software development is essential for improving the ROI and extending the life cycle of software products and services.

In my talk I will argue that technical excellence is impossible to buy from a software vendor and impossible to enforce in contractual terms.

The other side to this subject is my second argument: the only way to ensure technical excellence is to have a skilled and motivated team that takes responsible of it, and giving that team the responsibility and means to ensure technical excellence. I'll also talk about options how to achieve this.

The talk will be provocative. I will back my arguments with personal experiences as well as with anecdotes and research.</p>

    <p>Technical as it is, software is still created by human beings. Most of the time, several people form a team to deliver a certain project. What factors contribute to the success of the team? Obviously, external factors such as a good work environment and team members with proper skills play an important part. There is however one more essential ingredient, abstract and hard to measure: how well the team manages to work together, resolve conflicts and communicate, both internally and with the customer.
This talk will open your mind to how important effective communication is for the success and well-being of a software development team. You will learn how to improve communication using a set of ground rules that can help any work group reach the next level of collaboration.
