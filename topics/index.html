    <p>You've been there. You are tasked with implementing a product that someone else cooked up. What do do next? Follow the spec you say?</p>
    <p>Wrong!</p>
    <p>Developing a product without this Vision is not just waste, it is bad business for you and for your customer. Before we start implementing any product we must explore it's reason to exist, what customers it benefits and ultimately how it can help your customers (not you!) make money.</p>
    <p>In this workshop we will take an example and go through a simple process that helps us explore a product idea to the point that a spec is just a reference, but the product comes alive in the minds of the team members.</p>

    <p>Organisational change fails more often than it succeeds – so say some – but why? When promoting change in an organisation, have you considered the conditions that allow change to take place in the first place and to be sustainable afterwards? This interactive workshop start from the Six Conditions for Change from the work of Clare Graves and expands with some related models, all with the target of mentoring the participants on using the learning in practice.</p>

    <h3>Real Time Collaboration Workshop</h3>

    <p>Software development is not a production process but a collective creative process. Analogies would be improvisation theatre, team sports or the behaviour of socially living animals. The “collective” aspect of software development is not only about arranging duties and solving integration problems. The key part is distributing and sharing information and making individual knowledge available to all team members.</p>

	<p>Traditional approaches are asynchronous, rendering the team a set of individuals rather than a whole complete in itself as it is demanded by the agile philosophy. The step beyond is real-time collaboration: common synchronous crafting on the same artefacts by several individuals. Changes are distributed instantly; the artefact itself becomes an additional communication channel.</p>

	<p>This workshop is designed to give people a real feel for the different style of work without need for knowledge of specific software technologies or development approaches. We will give teams a task to accomplish together using Google Docs. You only need to bring a laptop that can run Google Docs.</p>

    <p>Liftoff – it's the unexplored, often ignored, Agile project practice. Liftoff gives impetus to your projects in a way that starts the project team, and the business, on the trajectory to success. As the first act of the flight, a rocket launch requires an entire set of systems to successfully lift the vehicle into orbit – not just the vehicle itself, but all the systems needed for smoothly moving off the ground into space. Likewise, your project needs its entire set of supporting systems in place to begin a successful journey to delivery.</p>
    <p> In this workshop based on her new book, Diana Larsen will lead you on an interactive mission to explore effective Liftoff meetings, including the newly introduced Agile Chartering model.</p>

  <div class="description column two-thirds">
    <p>With the emphasis on in-depth customer interaction during development, agile team members are being asked to take an active role in working with customers. This evolving role poses a big challenge for many who, in the past, rarely met “real” customers. Linda Rising presents patterns she has used successfully to help software professionals in their direct, face-to-face interactions with customers. These patterns describe solutions to common problems that occur again and again when dealing with customers and users.</p>
    <p>The patterns Linda discusses have memorable names such as It’s A Relationship—Not A Sale, Be Responsive, Show Personal Integrity, Build Trust, and Take Your Licks. Pattern names build a vocabulary that allows you and your development team to have meaningful conversations about—and to ultimately improve—customer relationships and the software you deliver.</p>
    <p>Benefits from this tutorial:
      <ul>
        <li>A vocabulary based on patterns to improve communication with customers</li>
        <li>Simple and powerful ways to improve your own personal interactions</li>
        <li>How to focus on what is best for both you and your customers</li>

    <p>Outside-in development doesn't mean starting at the user interface, it means starting at the outside of whatever you want to discover.</p>
     <p>On a brand new application, the first thing you need to discover is your domain model. Those fancy ajax gizmos can wait. This session will be a kata-style tutorial. Working from a single Cucumber scenario, we will drive out a domain model, then like BDD magicians, we'll slip in a user interface around the domain model without touching the tests.</p>
     <p>Attend this workshop to learn how to write Cucumber scenarios that last, by expressing them in the language of the domain. You'll learn how to engineer high-quality Cucumber step definition and support code, and see the benefits as your application evolves. A masterclass in BDD as it's meant to be done.</p>
     <p>This is intended to be a hands-on tutorial, so to take an active part, please ensure you have installed Ruby and the Cucumber, Capybara and Sinatra rubygems. If you just want to come along and watch, that's fine too.</p>

      Git is a versatile tool that can be adapted to multiple
      different workflows. Possibility to have feature branches, code
      reviews and rebase provide a solid toolset to maintain your code
      cleaner and let people collaborate without a big overhead of managing
      version control system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distributed version control systems have also added new and
      different ways to organize the work. No longer people have tied
      to a centralized server or internet connection, there's a new kind
      of freedom to do things.
    </p>
    <p>
      This workshop will go through practices that will help your
      everyday development using git. The idea is not to present One
      True Model(tm) that works everyday, but to offer you a set of
      tools that you can ground your own agile development workflow on.
      Aim is also to cover some more advanced topics of git, like
      rewriting history, hooks and recovering from disasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the workshop a laptop and basic knowledge of git are
      preferred, though not mandatory :)

    <p>Realtime monitoring provides everyone on a team, as well as interested stakeholders, with a shared and deepened understanding of how a system performs. Visualize it and you get direct feedback form the heart of your system. In this session we want to share our experiences with introducing monitoring and how the feedback it provided influenced both system design and team collaboration.</p>
    <p>We will use Graphite, a monitoring tool that makes data gathering no harder than printing “Hello world” and realtime visualization even easier. We will show how a monitoring tool like this; simple, instantly available and used continuously; was instrumental in implementing change in behaviour and collaboration.</p>

    <p>Why o why do I always fall into those Avalanche method (some call it waterfall) acceptance testing projects.. Well like the challenge, and there are always possibilities and methods for avoiding stiffness and becoming more agile, regardless of what it is you are told to do. I’ll talk about some of the ones I’ve sometimes found useful and which I would like people hiring, working with, or working as testers to think about.</p>

      <li>Why do system architects chose frameworks and write UML diagrams but do not write any code?</li>
      <li>Why do we measure how many lines of code a developer writes?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The theories of Frederick Taylor and those that followed them still today sets the norm for how organizations are managed. What we see as normal and common ways to organize work have their historical roots in early 1900's steel mills. These practices make agile adoption difficult, hinders empirical processes and self organizing teams.</p>

    <p>The talk provides an explanation to why IT-organizations are managed like factories, why these fail, and how to start the change into a succesful agile organization.</p>

    <p>As the author of The Cucumber Book, surely we'd expect Matt to be selling us on tools? Quite the opposite: This entertaining talk describes how so many teams get distracted by tools like Cucumber, and forget about what really matters. You'll leave with a clear vision of how BDD really works.</p>

    <p>Agile is all about empirical processes, controlled by feedback loops. But what does it mean?</p>
    <p>Most agile practices and principles are rooted in control theory. Truth be told, most ways of doing things well are. Knowing these root concepts will improve the outcome of any undertaking, software development or other. In this “popular science”-session, software development will be described as a (simplified) mathematical process. The session will teach how feedback, sensors, noise and delays affect outcome, error, robustness and other properties of a development process.</p>
