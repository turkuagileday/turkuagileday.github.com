It is my great pleasure to announce our next silver sponsor: Leonidas!

Leonidas is a company of passionate software developers.

We want to create more than just great code: we want to create great software for real need. We achieve it by mixing different skills: software developers, interaction designers, and others work in cross-functional teams. We use methods such as goal-directed design and prototyping to make sure our designs answer our customersâ€™ needs.
