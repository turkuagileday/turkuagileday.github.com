Testing with the Stars is an edu-taining experiment. A competition with world-class judges, namely [Lisa Crispin](/speakers/#lisa-crispin) and [Elisabeth Hendrickson](/speakers/#elisabeth-hendrickson). A competition where we all learn; state-of-the art testing tricks, collaboration techniques, and testing wisdom on how to reveal the most valuable parts of a software. Not to say it will be fun. It most certainly will be.

Do you want to be part of the show? It's easy. Just enroll to the conference for 2 whole days and select the competition as the workshop to attend.

Do you know a star we are looking for? Tip us his/her name and we will contact him/her.

Are you a star yourself? Please contact us!

It's going to be a whole day of testing fun. For more information, please see the [competition web page](/topics/testing-with-the-stars/).
