Are you coming to our event from the Helsinki region and possibly in need of a lift?

In that case, please do contact us at info@turkuagileday.fi or via Twitter! For together with Agile Finland we are planning to offer a free of charge special Turku Agile Day bus back and forth at least on the conference day the 15th of May.

All the details will form up shortly, but much depends on the interest for such an option. Thus we'd really like to hear from you if you consider joining the ride. Thank you!
