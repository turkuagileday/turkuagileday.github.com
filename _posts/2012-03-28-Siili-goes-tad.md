For our consultants, it is extremely important to work with the cutting edge technologies and to develop themselves continuously. Furthermore, our passion is to conduct our projects by using agile methods. This May we are heading to Turku Agile Day to hear the latest insides from the internationally acknowledged key note speakers.
 
Because for some of us, Turku is not yet a familiar scene, we want to offer a chance to join our bus ride for free. If you are attending Turku Agile Day but have no idea how to get there, join us and we will take you there on May 16th. Our bus leaves from Kamppi in the morning and will head back in the evening after the seminar dinner.
 
You can reserve your seat by sending us an email to [ilmoittautumiset@siili.fi](mailto:ilmoittautumiset@siili.fi). The amount of seats is limited, so let us know ASAP but at the latest on April 15th.
