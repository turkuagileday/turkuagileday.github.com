May is approaching fast, and #tad14 is only a few weeks away! If you haven’t already registered to the coziest software confrence in northern hemisphere, don’t worry. There is still time to do that!

Our <a href="https://registration.turkuagileday.fi/">Registration</a> is open, and it will stay open until 9.5.2014 at 12 am. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee special diets or personalized badges to those who register after May the 6th.

See you at #tad14!
