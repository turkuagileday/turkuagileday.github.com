    <p>I love Agile. I love how it can transform dull ineffective projects (and organizations) into exciting value-deliverers. I love how it can return the passion and fun into people's work. But I also recognize how hard it is to do right</p>
    <p>Over the last 7 years I've seen many successes and many, well, less successful cases. I've seen organizations both small and large, in Finland and internationally. I've trained more than 100 certified Scrum classes, and many other trainings. I've coached plenty of teams, Product Owners, ScrumMasters and organizational managers. Right now, I'm an Organisational ScrumMaster at Futurice, working with folks trying to create a successful, genuinely Agile organization. And I love my work. And my family :)</p>

    <p>A programmer for fun since 1984 and for pay since 1991, it wasn't before 2005 that Martin decided to do something about all the failing software projects in the world. Although changing the world one Scrum (or Kanban) project at a time is a good start, Martin is determined to rip up the industrial paradigm by the roots and replace it with something that makes sense in the software industry, preferably before next Friday (which would leave the weekend free). Most astonishingly, this plan has been in place unchanged for half a dozen years now, and must therefore be truly excellent.</p>
