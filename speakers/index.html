    <p>I love Agile. I love how it can transform dull ineffective projects (and organizations) into exciting value-deliverers. I love how it can return the passion and fun into people's work. But I also recognize how hard it is to do right</p>
    <p>Over the last 7 years I've seen many successes and many, well, less successful cases. I've seen organizations both small and large, in Finland and internationally. I've trained more than 100 certified Scrum classes, and many other trainings. I've coached plenty of teams, Product Owners, ScrumMasters and organizational managers. Right now, I'm an Organisational ScrumMaster at Futurice, working with folks trying to create a successful, genuinely Agile organization. And I love my work. And my family :)</p>

    <p>A programmer for fun since 1984 and for pay since 1991, it wasn't before 2005 that Martin decided to do something about all the failing software projects in the world. Although changing the world one Scrum (or Kanban) project at a time is a good start, Martin is determined to rip up the industrial paradigm by the roots and replace it with something that makes sense in the software industry, preferably before next Friday (which would leave the weekend free). Most astonishingly, this plan has been in place unchanged for half a dozen years now, and must therefore be truly excellent.</p>

"I	started	my	career	as	a	web	designer	in	a	small	Finnish	New	Media	Agency	in	
the	late	90's.	At	the	same	time	I	spent	my	free	time	studying	Digital	Arts	at	
Turku	University	of	Applied	Sciences	in	Turku	Finland.	My	first	working	day	
back	then	started	with	a	lesson	from	an	Art	Director.	the	title	of	this	lesson	was:	
"how	to	make	great	office	coffee".	On	the	second	day	I	also	learned	how	to	drink	
it!	My	primary	design	tool	back	in	those	days	was	Flash.	Making	cool	and	fancy	
websites	with	the	ultimate	trio	–Adobe	PhotoShop,	Dreamweaver	and	Flash.	It	
was	a	great	kick	off	(and	loads	of	fun	of	course!)	for	my	career.	Oh	those	were	
the	days!	Some	coffee	cups	and	couple of	websites	and	a	few	customer	cases	
later	I	nowadays	work	as	a	Concept	Designer	at	Ambientia.	My	team	is	just	
outstanding	and	it	is	a	privilege	to	work	with	these	excellent	Interaction	
Designers	and	Concept	Designers.
At	Turku	Agile	Day	2013 I	will	talk	about	using	personas	in	service	design	–
continuously.	How	to	make	sure	the	end	user	stays	in	our	focus	during	the	whole	
development	process	and	beyond	that	to	future	releases.	How	to	make	the	
whole	team	really	put	yourself	in	the	users'	shoes	(metaphorically	speaking…).
