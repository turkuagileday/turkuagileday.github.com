    <p> Software developer, hiking guide, supervisor - Aki is a man with multiple professions. <br> Working in agile(ish) projects since late 2006, Aki has been writing his code extensively using TDD. While still learning the core of TDD, Aki has seen some benefits of using it, namely more cohesive code, clearer responsibilities and code that’s easier to modify later. Being programmer means unleashing all his creativity on code while balancing on what’s valuable for the business and clients. Not all code needs to be clean - especially on brownfield projects. <br> In the future, though, you might see Aki working in areas far and away from IT - helping teams and individuals to find joy and meaning in their work. Want to hear more? Ask Aki what supervision is all about. </p>

    <p> Riina is working with creating modern, brain-friendly organizations. She is a misfit of "old-school" organizations' HR, where she worked for 10 years, until starting her own consultancy Extemporea , now working with Agile HR. She also enjoys her other work as an associate with the NeuroLeadership Group, which is bringing hard science to develop human performance and modern organizations globally. Pick a combo of engineering, coaching, scrum mastering, human resourcing, braining and socializing, stir it up and try to introduce that. If you have a short answer, could you please tell her, too. Thanks. </p>
