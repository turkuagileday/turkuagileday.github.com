    <p>Bob Marshall has dedicated his career to helping businesses dramatically improve the effectiveness of their software development and design engineering efforts. In the course of this career he has worked at the cutting edge of software and business systems development for the best part of thirty years. Throughout, he has consistently inspired people to improve their own capabilities – along with those of their teams and organisations. He spent three years as CEO of the UK’s first 100% agile software-intensive product-development and consultancy start-up, serving major clients in Telecoms, Finance, Media, eBusiness, etc., and has for the past nine years headed a Software Development Management Consultancy advising organisations how best to manage software-intensive product development in all its aspects.</p>
<p>Previously he held the role of Senior Java Architect with Sun Microsystems’ UK Java Center, and before that fulfilled many roles, from developer, analyst, designer and architect, through product-, project- and general management, consultancy, systems administration, and QA to operations, marketing and sales.</p>
<p>With a keen focus on business value, able to de-risk client projects and provide guaranteed outcomes, most of his assignments now revolve around working as a trusted advisor or interim executive to ambitious, growing technology-led companies, meeting the challenges involved in taking their businesses to the next level, and speeding the flow of innovation and value in their concept-to-cash pipelines. He is the founder of Rightshifting™, and the inventor of FlowChain™; the enterprise-wide approach to developing software-intensive products and services.</p>

    <p> Software developer, hiking guide, supervisor - Aki is a man with multiple professions. <br> Working in agile(ish) projects since late 2006, Aki has been writing his code extensively using TDD. While still learning the core of TDD, Aki has seen some benefits of using it, namely more cohesive code, clearer responsibilities and code that’s easier to modify later. Being programmer means unleashing all his creativity on code while balancing on what’s valuable for the business and clients. Not all code needs to be clean - especially on brownfield projects. <br> In the future, though, you might see Aki working in areas far and away from IT - helping teams and individuals to find joy and meaning in their work. Want to hear more? Ask Aki what supervision is all about. </p>

    <p>I work as a software architect at Solita which means I'm a jack of all trades. I still get to write the code, 
but I'm also responsible for understanding, clarifying and communicating the customer's needs.</p>
<p>I loathe low quality software riddled with bugs and consequently aim to improve the state of the art on a daily
basis. I firmly believe that improvement will always come from people working together. Regardless of what we 
consider the "best technology" or "best practices" today, something else will be considered "better" tomorrow. 
Defining and creating tomorrow is my ultimate goal at work.</p>
