<h2>Jurgen Appelo</h2>
<p>Jurgen Appelo is a <a href="http://www.management30.com/book/">writer</a>, <a href="http://www.jurgenappelo.com/speaking/">speaker</a>, <a href="http://www.jurgenappelo.com/training/">trainer</a>, entrepreneur, illustrator, developer, manager, blogger, reader, dreamer, leader, freethinker, and… Dutch guy.</p>
<p>Since 2008 Jurgen writes a popular blog at <a href="http://www.noop.nl/">www.noop.nl</a>, which deals with development management, software engineering, business improvement, personal development, and complexity theory. He is the author of the book <a href="http://www.management30.com/">Management 3.0: Leading Agile Developers, Developing Agile Leaders</a>, which describes the role of the manager in agile organizations. He is also a speaker, being regularly invited to talk at business seminars and conferences around the world.</p>
<p>After studying Software Engineering at the Delft University of Technology, and earning his Master’s degree in 1994, Jurgen Appelo has busied himself starting up and leading a variety of Dutch businesses, always in the position of team leader, manager, or executive. Jurgen has experience in leading a horde of 100 software developers, development managers, project managers, business consultants, quality managers, service managers, and kangaroos, some of which he hired accidentally.</p>
<p>Nowadays he works full-time developing innovative courseware, books, and other types of original content. But sometimes Jurgen puts it all aside to do some programming himself, or to spend time on his ever-growing collection of science fiction and fantasy literature, which he stacks in a self-designed book case. It is 4 meters high.</p>
<p>Jurgen lives in Rotterdam (The Netherlands) -- and sometimes in Brussels (Belgium) -- with his partner Raoul. He has two kids, and an imaginary hamster called George.

<div class="even"></p>
<h2>Petri Heiramo</h2>
<p>CollabNet Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) and Agile Transformation
Mentor, Owner of Agilecraft Oy</p>
<p>I’m particularly interested in looking at Scrum and Agile as a
holistic approach to improving the competitiveness of businesses. I
find myself often in discussions where I emphasize the need for
businesses to focus on generating value (over managing costs) as a
means to success. Be it in a project or in an organization, I
frequently see dysfunctions where silly savings are made at the cost
of significant value. And many times the decision makers are totally
unaware of the impact of their decisions. It is this mismatch between
intent (to work for the best of the company) and action that I seek to
eliminate. When focusing on value, we need to focus on customer
delight, job satisfaction and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>I've studied Agile methods actively since Fall 2005. In addition, to
leading Scrum and Agile projects, I have been doing Scrum and Agility
training and consulting since early 2006. I was certified as Scrum
Practitioner in April 2007 and as CST in November 2008.</p>
<p>I have over 10 years of experience in developing software as a
developer, project manager, QA manager, ScrumMaster, process
developer, coach and trainer – and experience with both the
traditional and Agile approaches to software development. I've seen a
wide variety of projects, and as a result, have come to appreciate the
positive effects of Scrum on the human side of software development.
Seeing people enjoy their work again has been my greatest joy in Agile
deployments. Of course, seeing a happy and engaged customer is great,
too, and so is instilling a new kind of pride and common sense in the
work people do.</p>
