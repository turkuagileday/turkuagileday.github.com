    <p>We want to create more than just great code: we want to create great software for real need. We achieve it by mixing different skills: software developers, interaction designers, and others work in cross-functional teams. We use methods such as goal-directed design and prototyping to make sure our designs answer our customers’ needs.</p>

    <p>On the technology front, our usual weapons of choice are high productivity tools such as Node.js, CoffeeScript, Ruby on Rails, Scala, and Haskell. However, choosing the most appropriate technology is important: when the situation calls for Java, we will use Java.</p>

    <p>We are looking for passionate software developers and interaction designers in Tampere and Helsinki. See <a href="http://leonidasoy.fi/jobs">http://leonidasoy.fi/jobs</a> for more information.</p>
